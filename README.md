**🔼🔽 Higher Lower Game**

A fun and interactive game where players guess whether the next item has a higher or lower value — could be numbers, follower counts, prices, or any custom dataset. Great for learning comparisons, logic, and user input handling!

**🕹️ Gameplay Overview**

The player is shown two options.
They must guess which one has a higher value (e.g., more followers, bigger number).
